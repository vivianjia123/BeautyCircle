## 1. Overview of the enterprise application <a name="section-1"></a>
The enterprise application our team chose to develop is an online cosmetics retail website that
supports a hypothetical cosmetics business “Beauty Circle”. The enterprise application supports
the business in selling cosmetics ranging from makeup, skincare, hair products and tools and
accessories. The enterprise consists of two types of users; customer and site administrator
features which have different privilege access to the website. In addition, customers can be
registered users or guest users (who have not registered)
The enterprise application assists Beauty Circle to achieve their business needs through the
following ways.
* Site Administrator can manage resources more efficiently as they can add, update or
delete stock through the website according to the inventory, sales or trends of the
market.
* Database will be linked to the website and store information about customers (registered
users only) and stock information.
* Customers are given more efficient methods to shop as they can view detailed
information of the product, add products into their shopping cart and generate orders by
checking out their shopping cart.
* Registered users can automatically check out through saved cards in their accounts
whereas guest users will be required to enter their payment information and shipping
and payment address.
* All customers paying to the business will pay through an external system that is linked to
the enterprise application.
* Registered users have additional functions compared to guest users as they can view
their account to view their personal information (such as their cards saved and
addresses) and they can also add items into their wishlist to purchase in the future.
